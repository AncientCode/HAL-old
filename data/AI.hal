#IS AI A BAD *
The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible.

Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.
It depends on your view.
Its your opinion, not mine.
I do not think that artificial intelligence is a bad ^.

#IS AI ABOUT *
Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do.

#WHAT IS A CHAT ROBOT
A chat robot is a program that attempts to simulate the conversation or "chat" of a human being.
